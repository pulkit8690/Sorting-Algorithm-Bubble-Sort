# Bubble-Sort

The bubble sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the bubble sort algorithm:

1. Start with an unsorted list of elements.
2. Compare the first element with the second element. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements (second and third) and compare them. Again, swap if necessary.
4. Continue this process, comparing and swapping adjacent elements, until you reach the end of the list. By the end of the first iteration, the largest element will be in its correct position at the end of the list.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining unsorted portion of the list (excluding the last element, as it is already sorted).
6. Continue these iterations until the entire list is sorted.
